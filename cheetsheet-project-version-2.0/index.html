        <h3>Html Basics</h3>
        <p>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code used to structure a web
          page and it's content.For examplw, content could be structured within
          a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and
          data tables. As the title suggests, this section will cover the basics
          of HTML and it's functions.
        </p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>
          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you can enclose, or wrap,
          different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act
          a certain way. For example, look at the following lone of content
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
          <pre>
          <code>
<span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="s">"type"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;span&gt;</span>CSS typewriter<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span> 
            </code>
        </pre>
        </div>
        <h3>The anatomy of an HTTML element</h3>
        <img src="./resources/images/image-1.png" alt="HTML anatomy" />
        <h3>The main parts of the HTML element are:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The <em>opening tag </em>: This is the name of the element (in this
            case, p) wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states
            where the element begins or starts to take effect - in this case
            where the paragraph begins
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>Closing Tag </em>: This is the same as the opening tag,
            except that it includes a foward slash before the element name. This
            states where the element ends - in this case, where the paragraph
            ends. failing to add the closing tag is one of the beginner errors
            and can lead to stramge results.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>Content </em>: This is the content of the element. which in
            this case is just text.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>Element</em>: The opening tag and the closing tag coming
            together with the content to create the element.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
